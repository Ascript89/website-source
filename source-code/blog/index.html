            <p>
                I've been using the new browser from the Opera Poland team for almost a year
                (November 2020). My experience with this browser has been superb, becoming my
                favourite one. It's oriented for gaming users, but everyone can use it obviously.
                Look at me! I almost don't use some of the advantages it got for gamers, and I
                still find it suitable for me!
            </p>
            <p>
                Opera GX is pretended to be used by gamers, including nice tools and utilities for these
                kind of users:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Lateral bar: it's a bar you've got on the left side of the browser window.
                        It's also present in the regular version of Opera for desktop, having in this
                        almost the same function. You can access many social media pages from there
                        instead of opening a ton of tabs just every single social media, and also
                        shortcuts to some apps and functions of Opera GX which are described below.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        GX Corner: be up to date with new free games or just new releases for PC
                        and consoles. It's like a fixed tab you've got on the browser, but you
                        can hide it on the lateral bar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        GX Cleaner: a nice cleaner to get more space on your disk, by removing
                        cookies, cach√©, downloads, browser history and more shit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        GX Control: a tool to limit the CPU and RAM usage and Internet bandwidth,
                        so you can play games with the browser opened doing some tasks or just with
                        some tabs you don't want to close.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Now I'll continue with some other nice features of the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also a Force Dark Mode, with this 'tool' you can force dark mode on webs which
                don't have one, like Google, for example. This is also implemented in the
                experiments page of every single browser based on Chromium (accessible through
                <a class="text-link" href="chrome://flags/#force-dark-mode">Chrome Flags</a>).
                So, if this is available in every single Chromium-based navigator, why is it special?
                Well they added a button in the context menu of the website display, so you can
                enable/disable it. With a toggle in the quick settings so you can force every single
                website to be dark. However, if there are some websites you don't ever want to be dark,
                there's a whitelist in the settings where you can set the URL of the website to whitelist.
            </p>
            <p>
                It has a nice adblocker for websites, and also for YouTube and YouTube Music. And also a
                tool called Flow, so you can share websites and things of your desktop browser with the
                mobile version of Opera. Furthermore, it got a nice detail I'd like to talk about, which
                is the file upload to the web. When a website asks you to upload a file, the file explorer
                opens automaticly, but with Opera, this isn't like that. A little popup appears, so you can
                choose between uploading whatever image you've got in the clipboard, a recent file you downloaded
                or just open the file explorer to look through your things. This is really useful when I
                do a search on Google Images, or any other place where I want to upload something I've got in
                the clipboard, but I don't want to save it on my computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are also some special things for personalization, but I think they're not quite as
                important as what I've mentioned before, and they are almost the same options you'll find
                in the regular version of Opera. In summary, it's a really nice browser with some details,
                that you'll like in the day a day.
            </p>

                This article has NOT been sponsored. I just decided to write it becuase it's a browser
                I really like.
