                Gets his first phone and plays Geometry Dash after 3

                Some months before lockdown due to Covid, he discovers many
                GD-related communities, including GDPSes. Around March he
                creates his account on XGDPS, after liking the owner of the
                GDPS, and a month after, he joines WGDPS, where he would
                highlight in the community around GDPSes (not really highlight
                but starts being known in the community). 
                <br><br>
                In the summer, he creates many levels in WGDPS and develop some
                software tools for it, and using the excuse of GDPS modding to
                start developing some programs and websites, and also learning
                about how is GD in depth. However, he would drop off .NET apps
                development for Windows, as he didn't really know any compiled
                language to develop good worthy apps.
                <br><br>
                Getting to the end of his activity at WGDPS, he starts his own
                independent project codenamed "GDPS Public Marketplace", and
                calling it GDPS Hub afterwards. Starts getting quite a good
                level on front-end development.

                LBlazen joins the developing team for GDPS Hub, and build a
                new notable community in GDPSes. They start releasing the
                first beta builds after rewriting 3 times the website.
                His level on front-end development improves a lot.
                <br><br>
                He also leaves every GDPS forever, except WGDPS just because
                of all the effort and good memories he has from there.

                He's developing and designing for GDPS Hub, while focusing
                more on his own things rather than playing GDPSes, although
                his projects are related to them.
