# Main website source
Here you can find the source code for my main website (ascript89.github.io).
You can use it wherever you want ;D (as long as you always respect the license).

PLEASE READ:
Please, if you are going to use pieces of my code (or just the whole website),
make sure to credit me somewhere in your website, there's no need it's in big
neon letters, just in the credits or the footer of the site, it'd help me a lot,
thanks.
